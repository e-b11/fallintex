Repository for Fall 2023 INTEX
Social Media website w/ forms

The URL for our website is https://provosmh.is404.net/
No, this is not Provo "Shaking my head" it is Provo "Social Media Health."


When you navigate to the website you can see the home page which has an overview of the survey and results.
All visitors can take the survey which enters their responses into a live database. Visitors also have access to a view containing a dashboard that pulls information directly from the database hosted 
on AWS RDS.

The dashboard can also be accessed on Tableau public at https://public.tableau.com/views/IntexGroup3-3/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

Admin credentials are as follows: Username: admin  Password: admin
The site uses cookies to authenticate admin users and give them access to the admin views. Logging out by using the link in the top menu will alter the user's cookies and therefore revoke their access again until they log in again. 

Admins have access to a number of other views including access to view individual responses and their accompanying information. Our team created a powerful search engine that lets you filter based on a number of different criteria using the dropdown menu. Simply enter the category to filter, the value you want to search for, and the limit (the number of rows you want to display). 
Admins also have access to view Admin account information for all admin users; on that page admins can create new admins, update current admin information, and delete existing admin accounts.  

This website will give Provo City's Social Media Usage and Mental Health Committee the tools it needs to explore the relationships between Social Media and Mental health within its city by collecting responses from residents and exploring the results with the search engine   and the live dashboard. 
This website will also raise awareness to these issues to the general public.
